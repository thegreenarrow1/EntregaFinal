                About me
            </h1>
            <p>Since I was a child, I had a great passion for drawing and building houses. Over the years, this hobby
                grew and my tastes for <strong>graphic design</strong> gradually increased until it was time to make the
                most important decision that a teenager can have, to choose what their educational project will be with
                the one who will grow as a professional and will be able to achieve support that allows him to live a
                life to the fullest and enjoy what he does.</p>
            <p>From the beginning of my career to train as a graphic design professional, I had a great passion and
                attraction for the different projects that I was facing as a student. In 2017 I finally received my
                <strong>Bachelor's Degree in Design</strong> and started working on what I was so passionate about.</p>
            <p>Over the years my ambition led me to discover the world of programming, which made me realize that it was
                something I wanted to complement my work as a graphic designer with. This is how I am currently training
                as a programmer.</p>
